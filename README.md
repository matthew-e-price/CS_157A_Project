# Instructions

IMPORTANT: We currently only have this code working as is in IntelliJ IDEA

1) First pull the code from github into IntelliJ IDEA
2) Next, you need to locate the pom.xml file at the following location:
    - cs157_group_project/pom.xml
3) Right click the pom.xml file and select "Maven -> Reload project"
4) After this you can safely run Application to start the backend
5) Next, right click cs157_group_project_frontend and open it in the terminal
6) Now in the terminal, run the command "npm install"
7) After this, you can now run "npm start" to start the frontend
8) The website should open in your browser, and it will continue running until terminated

NOTE: Unfortunately there wasn't enough manpower to implement checks on all the inputs, so please be reasonable with what you use
